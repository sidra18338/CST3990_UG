          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
              At Campus to Career, our vision is to make career building simple, effective, and accessible. We started with a simple idea: to connect students with trusted companies offering internship opportunities that will jump-start their careers. Since then, we've grown into a powerful platform dedicated to empowering students and helping them shape a successful future.
          </p>
          <p>
              Our platform bridges the gap between students and the professional world. We believe that the transition from campus life to career success should be seamless, and we are here to help guide that journey.
